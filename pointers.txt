STRUCTS:
A struct is a structure that groups related variables (members) under one name. 
They can contain different data types. 
Members can be accessed with . "Class Member Access Operator".

POINTERS:
Variable that stores a memory address of another variable.

NULL POINTERS:
A null value represents something that has no value.
When a pointer is holding a null value, that pointer is not pointing at anything (null pointer).
The keyword that represents a null pointer literal is nullptr.
These are helpful to determine if an address was succesfuly assigned to a pointer.
